	<blockquote> We are planning on using the Diverging Stacked Bar Chart to display the data. One stacked bar can easily display the distribution of voter preferences at any particular time. A series of stacked bars can show how voter preferences change over time. One chart will be used to display the data on each candidate. Comparing the graphs of different candidates will give the user an idea of how different campaigns change relative to each other.
